# Binary Search Tree Project
## [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] Binary Search Tree 
1- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.

2- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

3- For given array ;

 - Root is 7 
 
 - 5<7 ,so            
                                              7
                                        5      
             
 - 1<7 & 1<5      
                                                  7
                                          5
                                       1
- 8>7 
                                                   7
                                          5               8
                                       1     
 - 3<7 & 3<5 & 3>1
